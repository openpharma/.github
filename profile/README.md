# OpenPharma 

This Github organization is managed under the following principals:

- openpharma strives to allow collaboration where there is no implied ownership based on the github organisation used. openpharma was originally created to host a project between Roche, Janseen and Novartis where no company wanted to imply ownership by placing it in their own company github organisations
- openpharma allows repositories housed within it to set their own governance model
- openpharma is open to any project related to the Pharma industry
- openpharma makes no assumptions on what packages are part of an ‘ideal’ workflow
- a preference is always placed on opensource from day 1, but openpharma will also host packages in private repos on request
- currently, admin access to the org is shared between Roche and Novartis
- openpharma will not hold any IP or copyright of associated projects, it will not be a platform for discussion or host initiatives, and it will not release opinions or standards on which repositories form part of an ideal workflow.
- all projects added to openpharma must have an open source license and specify how the repository authors wish to assign copyright

Promoting collaboration on projects:

- in parrallel to hosting repos, openpharma maintains an inclusive list of collaborative projects hosted on github.com that goes beyond those physically hosted in github.com/openpharma. This is hosted at openpharma.pharmaverse.org.
